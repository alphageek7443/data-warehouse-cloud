# Use Notification Bubbles in SAP Datasphere
<!-- description --> Understand notification bubbles in SAP Datasphere, whose purpose is to signal changes that happen in the data models as well as their severity.

## Prerequisites
- Have at least one graphical view created and deployed in SAP Datasphere -- see [Model Data with a Graphical View](data-warehouse-cloud-graphical1-model).

## You will learn
- How to understand different notification bubbles
- How to track changes with information bubbles
- How to be aware of issues with warning bubbles
- How can you make use of error bubbles


## Intro 
The notification bubbles in SAP Datasphere are not just notifications! A click on a bubble will give you additional information and suggest actions to resolve any underlying issues.

### Get to know the information bubbles


You will see the blue information bubbles in case of changes or updates to your data models.

For example, if an underlying source table used in your view has been changed, you will see a notification bubble. With these bubbles, it is easy for you to see when any changes have been made.

### Get to know the warning bubbles


You will see the orange warning bubbles when changes or actions may cause issues.
For example, if you save a data flow without the final output table or with a branch that is not connected to any outputs, this would prompt a warning. These bubbles say: This may not work â€“ proceed with caution!

### Get to know the error bubbles


Finally, red error bubbles highlight errors and situations that need your intervention.

Some of the examples create an impossible join condition or having a syntax error in a formula.

> Please note from release `2021.10` on, a new version history is created each time a model is successfully deployed. Those versions can be retrieved through a specific endpoint.
